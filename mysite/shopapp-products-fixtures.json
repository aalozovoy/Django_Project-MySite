      "description": "Smartphone is a mobile phone (modern — usually with a touch screen), complemented by the functionality of a smart device.\r\n\r\nAlso, the communicator is originally a pocket personal computer, complemented by the functionality of a mobile phone. Currently, the boundary between the terms \"smartphone\" and \"communicator\" can be considered completely erased.\r\n\r\nAlthough mobile phones almost always had additional functions (calculator, calendar), more and more intelligent models were released over time. In order to emphasize the increased functionality and computing power of such models, the term \"smartphone\" was introduced. In the era of the growing popularity of smartphones, they began to be produced with mobile phone functions, such devices were called communicators. Currently, the division into smartphones and communicators is no longer relevant, now both terms mean the same thing — a miniature universal computer with full-fledged user interfaces and advanced radio interfaces of a mobile phone, the term \"communicator\" has practically ceased to be used.\r\n\r\nSmartphones differ from conventional mobile phones by having an operating system open to software development by third-party developers (the operating system of conventional mobile phones is closed to third-party developers). Installing additional applications allows you to significantly improve the functionality of smartphones compared to conventional mobile phones.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently the line between \"regular\" phones and smartphones has been increasingly blurred, new phones (with the exception of the cheapest models) have long acquired functionality once inherent only in smartphones, for example, email and HTML browser, as well as multitasking.",
